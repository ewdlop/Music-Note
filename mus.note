Muspy is a Python library for handling symbolic music data, which can be used for tasks such as music generation, processing, and analysis. It provides a convenient way to work with music in the form of MIDI files or other symbolic formats.

### Key Features of Muspy

- **Music Representation**: Handles symbolic music data with various representations, including notes, chords, and tempos.
- **File I/O**: Supports reading from and writing to MIDI files and various other formats.
- **Data Manipulation**: Provides tools for transposing, stretching, and other transformations of musical data.
- **Visualization**: Includes functions for visualizing music data.

### Installation

You can install Muspy using pip:

```sh
pip install muspy
```

### Example: Loading, Modifying, and Saving a MIDI File

Here's a simple example of how to use Muspy to load a MIDI file, transpose it, and save the result:

```python
import muspy

# Load a MIDI file
music = muspy.read_midi("jingle_bells.mid")

# Transpose all notes up by 2 semitones
for track in music.tracks:
    for note in track.notes:
        note.pitch += 2

# Save the transposed music to a new MIDI file
muspy.write_midi("jingle_bells_transposed.mid", music)

print("Transposition complete. Saved to 'jingle_bells_transposed.mid'.")
```

### Explanation

1. **Loading the MIDI File**:
   ```python
   music = muspy.read_midi("jingle_bells.mid")
   ```
   This function reads a MIDI file and converts it into a Muspy `Music` object.

2. **Transposing Notes**:
   ```python
   for track in music.tracks:
       for note in track.notes:
           note.pitch += 2
   ```
   This loop iterates over all tracks and notes in the `Music` object, increasing the pitch of each note by 2 semitones.

3. **Saving the Transposed Music**:
   ```python
   muspy.write_midi("jingle_bells_transposed.mid", music)
   ```
   This function writes the modified `Music` object back to a new MIDI file.

### Visualizing the Music

Muspy also allows you to visualize the music data. Here's how you can plot the piano roll of the music:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot the piano roll
music.plot_pianoroll()
plt.show()
```

This will display a piano roll visualization of the music, showing the notes and their durations.

### Additional Resources

For more advanced usage and functionalities, you can refer to the [Muspy documentation](https://salu133445.github.io/muspy/).

With Muspy, you can perform a wide range of music processing tasks efficiently, making it a valuable tool for anyone working with symbolic music data in Python. If you have any specific questions or need further examples, feel free to ask!

Sure! Let's delve deeper into how you can use the Muspy library for more advanced music analysis and manipulation tasks.

### Advanced Example: Analyzing and Visualizing Melody and Harmony

In this example, we'll load a MIDI file, analyze its melody and harmony, and visualize the results using Muspy and Matplotlib.

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
   ```sh
   pip install muspy matplotlib
   ```

2. **Load the MIDI File**:
   Use the `muspy` library to load the MIDI file.

3. **Extract Melody and Harmony**:
   Analyze the melody and harmony from the MIDI data.

4. **Visualize the Results**:
   Use `matplotlib` to create visualizations of the melody and harmony.

### Example Code

Here’s an example code that demonstrates these steps:

```python
import muspy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load a MIDI file
music = muspy.read_midi("jingle_bells.mid")

# Extract melody (highest pitch per time step)
melody = muspy.extract_melody(music)

# Extract harmony (all notes except melody)
harmony = muspy.extract_harmony(music)

# Plot melody
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 5))
melody.plot_pianoroll()
plt.title('Melody of Jingle Bells')
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Pitch')
plt.show()

# Plot harmony
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 5))
harmony.plot_pianoroll()
plt.title('Harmony of Jingle Bells')
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Pitch')
plt.show()
```

### Explanation

1. **Loading the MIDI File**:
   ```python
   music = muspy.read_midi("jingle_bells.mid")
   ```
   This function reads a MIDI file and converts it into a Muspy `Music` object.

2. **Extracting Melody and Harmony**:
   ```python
   melody = muspy.extract_melody(music)
   harmony = muspy.extract_harmony(music)
   ```
   - `extract_melody` extracts the highest pitch per time step, representing the melody.
   - `extract_harmony` extracts all other notes, representing the harmony.

3. **Plotting the Melody**:
   ```python
   plt.figure(figsize=(14, 5))
   melody.plot_pianoroll()
   plt.title('Melody of Jingle Bells')
   plt.xlabel('Time')
   plt.ylabel('Pitch')
   plt.show()
   ```

4. **Plotting the Harmony**:
   ```python
   plt.figure(figsize=(14, 5))
   harmony.plot_pianoroll()
   plt.title('Harmony of Jingle Bells')
   plt.xlabel('Time')
   plt.ylabel('Pitch')
   plt.show()
   ```

### Additional Analysis

You can perform more advanced analysis using Muspy, such as:

- **Transposition**: Changing the key of the music.
- **Quantization**: Aligning notes to a grid to correct timing.
- **Tempo and Time Signature Analysis**: Analyzing the tempo and time signature changes.

Here’s an example of transposing the music and plotting the result:

```python
# Transpose all notes up by 5 semitones
music.transpose(5)

# Plot the transposed music
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 5))
music.plot_pianoroll()
plt.title('Transposed Jingle Bells')
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Pitch')
plt.show()
```

### Conclusion

Muspy is a powerful tool for analyzing and manipulating symbolic music data. By combining Muspy with visualization libraries like Matplotlib, you can gain deep insights into the structure and content of musical pieces.
